Stock scraper

Scrapes Yahoo Finance for about 6000 stocks, which takes up about 500MB.
With a 50 Mib/s connection it took about 4 minutes to download it all.
Add lines in the first column to the `ticker_list.csv` file to download more. If you do, please add it as a pull request as I want this to be as extensive as possible.
